# Eggs-in-Baskets
A simple program meant to visualize the allocation of sparse resources (eggs) to different ends (baskets)

An example of how this might be used is hours in a day. You will initialize with 24 eggs. You know you always want to sleep eight hours, so you will add a basket called "Sleep". You will move eight eggs to this basket. You know you work eight hours a day, so you will add a "work" basket and move eight eggs to it. Now you have only eight eggs left. Throughout a day, you spend an hour driving, an hour eating/cooking. You make the appropriate baskets. Now you have 6 eggs left. Now you can start dividing up free time activities until you find you have no eggs left. Do you find you don't have enough eggs for all the baskets you want in your life? Well, now you can either pull eggs from one basket to another or restart the whole thing with 168 eggs for a full week. 

On initialization, you will specify how many eggs you want. Then you will add baskets. Eggs are drag and drop. Clicking a none empty basket will remove an egg and allow you to drag it.
